## calculator-constructor

Drag-and-drop calculator constructor

https://noi5enu1sanc3.github.io/calculator-constructor/

- TypeScript, React
- Redux Toolkit
- dnd-kit
- eslint


## Features

- Constructor/runtime mode toggle
- Dragging and dropping blocks to canvas
- Sorting blocks that are already on canvas
- (Almost) fully functional calculator

## TODO:

- Refactor useCalculator hook
- Mobile version
- Force drop indicator after locked display block
- Adjust collision detection (as for now moving blocks feels not smooth enough, especially large ones)
- Adding keyboard and touch sensors for drag-and-drop
